Everything we do on computers and smartphones has some sort of code behind it telling it what to do. But have you ever thought about how this code gets written? 
There are thousands of languages in the world around us, and in the the digital world, things aren+IBk-t so different. There are also tons of different programming languages making up the code that powers much of our technology.
A programming language consists of basic terms and instructions used to produce some form of output, such as websites , applications, and other software. Languages like JavaScript, Python, and Java are often used by websites for a variety of purposes. C+-+- is used just about everywhere to make things like desktop apps, games, and more. 
There+IBk-s also HTML and CSS. While these aren+IBk-t technically programming languages, they+IBk-re used to create the structure and appearance of almost every website.
These are just a few of the most popular languages, but there are also many, many more. The reason for this is that all of these languages are unique and operate differently from one another.
To further explain this, let's take a look at vehicles. There are all different types of vehicles in the world, and most of them can get you from point A to point B. Which one you choose, however, depends on several factors. 
Some of them might be faster than others, and certain vehicles might take more skill or training to operate. In some instances, one vehicle might work better than another, like if you needed to move some bulky objects. But in a lot of cases, most modes of transportation can get the job done, and it just comes down to what you personally prefer. 
All of these qualities about vehicles also apply to programming languages. For example, a web developer might choose to use JavaScript because it works well with HTML, while a video game designer might choose C+-+- because it can handle more complex graphics.
Without programming languages, most of the technology we use on a daily basis would be useless. When it comes down to it, they're simply the backbone of all of our software.

<h2> How programing languages work </h2>
The study of any language, natural or artificial, focuses on the two fundamentals of the language: syntax and semantics. Syntax of language takes into account the format, form, and compositional structure of the language. For example the sentence: three red dog, is syntactically incorrect. The syntax of a computer language is defined as the form of its expressions, statements, and program units. Semantics on the other hand have to do with the meaning behind what is being expressed. The sentence: Thoughtful body greens instigate butterflies, is syntactically correct, but has no semantic meaning. Semantics, in programming language, refer to the meaning of the expressions, statements, and program units in the syntax of the language.
</br>
<br>
<h2> Syntax </h2>
The syntax of a language can help determine popularity and ease of use of a specific programming language. If a programmer finds himself or herself struggling through the syntax of a language, the programmer can easily switch to one of the other languages currently available. Like natural languages, programming languages have symbols called characters. These characters are put together in strings and these strings combine to form sentences. The simplest form of these strings is called a lexeme. Lexemes are also separated into groups, called identifiers, by various criteria. The criteria for separation can include methods, classes, or names of variables. The categories these lexemes belong to are called tokens. For example, the lexeme, index, is in the token named, identifier. These tokens are then parsed. Parsing recognizes the tokens in a sentence and determines its structure relating to the formal grammar of the language. Formal grammar of a language relates to the syntax rules implemented. Formal grammar only relates to form and not content. The following are some lexemes in the C programming language.
Grammar of programming languages can be classified into various categories using the Chomsky hierarchy, a system devised by Noam Chomsky in the mid 1950s.  The hierarchy consists of 4 classes for grammar;  Type-0, Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3.  Type-0 consists of the unrestricted grammars.  It contains all formal grammars, and they generate all languages that can be recognized by a Turing Machine.  These types of languages are also known as recursively enumerable languages.  Type-1 is made of context sensitive grammars, which generate context sensitive languages.  Type-2 includes context free grammars, which spawn context free languages.  Context free languages are usually the basis for the syntax of most programming languages.  Type-3 consists of regular grammars, which create regular languages.  Although there are other forms of grammars, they are not included in the hierarchy.
</br>
<br>
<h2> Semantics </h2>
 Once the syntax of a programming language is revealed and understood, the semantics of the language must be defined.  Formal semantics of a programming language can be approached in three methods.
 The first is denotational semantics, where every phrase in the language is imaged to a phrase in a different language.  Usually the image language is mathematically based.  This is the basic idea behind compiling languages.
 The second class of semantics is operational semantics.  Operational semantics execute the language presented directly, rather than translating to another language.  This class gives meaning to elements in the code by describing the changes they make of the various states of the machine.
 The third class is axiomatic semantics, where meaning is given to various phrases by relating the logical axioms that apply to each individual phrase.  There is no difference between the actual meaning of the phrase and the formulas that are used to describe it.  This form of semantics is based on logical methods and formulas.

<h2> Types </h2>
 Data can be viewed as a collection of bits place in a certain order.  Programming languages can take these bits, and build up all data from them.  This could form a machine within the computer and incorporate it as part of the programming language being used.  This data can be classified into certain data types.  A data type is a set of values, together with a set of operations on those values having certain properties.  A type system views these data types, and defines how a programming language assigns certain expressions and values to them.  These systems are in place to make sure that programs are error free and detect many errors in code.  Sometimes, the type systems work a little too well and find errors in perfectly written code.  To circumvent these problems, many programmers can construct loopholes and bypass the type system.
 To ensure proper execution of code, a policing system must be maintained to solidify and enforce the grammar in place.  Type checking is used to look for errors in code.  Type checking is the process a translator goes through to verify that all constructs in a program make sense in terms of the types of its various entities.  An algorithm is used which checks the equivalence between expressions and statements.  Two types of type checking exist, static and dynamic.
</br>
<br>
 <h2> Static Type Checking </h2>
 Static type checking determines the types of objects and expressions from the actual text of the program.  The check is performed before the execution of the program.  Static checking allows compilers to allocate memory and generate code that manipulates data efficiently, so execution efficiency is enhanced.  It also reduces the amount of code that must be compiled improving translation efficiency.  This type of checking also catches plenty of errors early, which improve the writability of a language.  Static type checking make for a more rigid set of rules and reduces programmer flexibilities.
</br>
<br>
<h2> Dynamic Type Checking </h2>
 Dynamic type checking on the other hand is checked during the running of the program and tends to be more flexible than the static checking.  Certain programming languages like JavaScript, due to their dynamic type binding, allow only dynamic type checking.
 Using type checking type strength of a programming language can be determined.  Strong typing is a highly valuable characteristic of a programming language.  A program is strongly typed if errors in the code are always detected.  This requires that all elements of operation can be specifically determined either using dynamic or static type checking methods.  Conversely, a weakly typed language allows an element to be imaged as a different element type.  Although this may be useful in many instances, this can wreak havoc, allowing many errors to pass though the error detection process.

<h2> Libraries </h2>
 The 1990s brought into focus the use of libraries.  Libraries are a collection of classes or subroutines used to develop software.  Historically, libraries were deemed to be unimportant in programming languages, because they were not part of the actual language.  They were seen as an interface issue rather than a coding or programming concern.  Some languages completely ignored the use of libraries altogether, and opted to go towards having the input-output functions incorporate into the language itself.  However, with the evolution of technology to the high levels of the 21st century, the idea of libraries is essential.  Libraries full of rich capabilities, are being written in system independent ways, are being incorporated into the languages themselves.  This new approach to libraries is imperative to have a successful highly functioning language.  A perfect example of a highly used, modern language than depends on libraries is Java.  As one of the most popular languages in the world, Java may have just disappeared into the realm of lost programming languages if it had not used the Java Application Program Interface.  C +-+-, yet another extremely popular language, uses a standard library containing many utilities which make C +-+- the successful language it is.

<h2> Library Types </h2>
 Just as programming languages and technology has evolved from from humble beginnings to the powerful driving forces of the 21st century, so have libraries.  Initial libraries were fairly simple and were not as involved as the giant forces they have become.  The various types of libraries are:
 Static Libraries: Static libraries were the first libraries in existence.  Originally, all libraries were static, and referred to as archives.  These archives were made of routines, which were copied by a linking agent, usually a compiler, to the desired application.  This act, called a static build, produced object files, and an executable file.  The linking agent loads all the codes and libraries into the proper memory location, which can take long amounts of time, depending on the operation.  Some languages have incorporated smart linking, which allows the compiler to recognize the libraries needed and only use the essential aspects needed.  This reduces memory use and runtime.
 Dynamic Linking: Dynamic Linking helps reduce compile time by loading the subroutines of a library.  All the .DLL files which accompany applications are responsible for speeding up the actions performed while running the application.  This is one of the reasons that many modern programs may take some time while starting up, but are very fast while executing requests.  One disadvantage to dynamic linking is that the application running depends on the linking agent to find and order the stored libraries.  If any of the libraries are deleted, misplaced, renamed, damages, incomplete, or moved, the library cannot be copied and the executable file will fail.
 Shared Libraries: Shared libraries are another classification of libraries, which relates to the availability of the library to a variety of programs.  Two concepts are incorporated in shared libraries.  First, a library is shared if it is shares code located on the local disk by other programs unrelated to each other.  Second, is when the library shares code with the memory, or RAM.  Dynamic libraries are almost always shared, while static can never be shared due to their static nature.  The most popular operating systems uses shared libraries because it allows for only one loader, and secondly the applications and other executable files to be used as dynamic libraries.
 Remote Libraries: Remote libraries are libraries located on another server or computer.  These libraries are accessed over a network using a remote procedure call.  This allows for a computer or machine located in a different country to use the same libraries in the United States.
 Object-Oriented Libraries: Just as object-oriented programming has increased in popularity, it only makes sense that object libraries follow.  Object-oriented programming requires various data that which are not found in normal libraries.  These special libraries must contain a list of objects that the entry point and names of the code depend on.  Cross platform applications and systems usually use object libraries to expand their overall audience.  Many developers like IBM, COBRA, and Sun Microsystems quickly jumped on these opportunities to increase their profits.
 Class Libraries: Very similar to the object libraries are the class libraries.  Class libraries represent object libraries, but usually relate to older type codes.  These class libraries help describe methods and characteristics of objects.
