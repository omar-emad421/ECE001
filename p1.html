Communication has been a central factor in human evolution, socialization, and civility. Since the early grunts of our first homostadial ancestors, to the nuanced complexities of the multitude of complex languages of the present day, mankind has needed a means of passing ideas and concepts to each other. The invention of writing over 7000 years ago assisted in idea transition and helped advance human civilization in every area of our everyday lives. The absence of a shared language would make it almost impossible for a person to perform some task effectively, or to clarify an idea conceptualized by another. Formal language has developed into a constantly evolving malleable construct to meet the needs of modern humans and has become a link between humans of the 21st century and the machines they made. Much as human knowledge has been passed on to one another for centuries, People now have the capacity to interact entirely, through formal languages, through their electronic and mechanical creations that other machines can understand. Such languages, known as programming languages, are in fact the key to the future of computers, software, and technology. Without these languages many modern day technologies would be reduced to costly paperweights of silicon and plastic.
A programming language can be described as a notational system for the machine-readable and human-readable representation of computation. In a simpler way itâ€™s notation to express what you want it to do to a machine. Though humans and machines can communicate by programming languages, there are limitations. In comparison to human natural languages, programming languages can only enable exchange of algorithmic concepts, and can not easily communicate or comprehend human emotions. Machines read the message, and if they understand what is being told, they do as they said.Since the invention of the first complex machines, humans have been devising more intricate ways of communication with their machine to employ more efficient techniques to complete their goals.
